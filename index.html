             <h1>Economy</h1>
              <br>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>During the first half of the first century modernism started and that make a big change to the world, a lot of industries opened, many countries got colonized by the superpowers all around the world. A lot of economic changes happened during this specific era. This makes this period very interesting to read about. Focusing on economy will make you want to read the whole article to know how economy evolved.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  <h3>Colonialism</h3>
                    <p>Under a long time during the modern many superpowers had colonized smaller countries in Africa and Asia. These superpowers took raw material from the colonies and transported these materials to their own country, and used it to make products. If we take Great Britten and India as an example, the British people took cotton from India to their country and made clothes of it, then they brought it back to India and sold it as a finished product, that made Indian people angry, one of the people who didn´t buy or even use these clothes was Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi thought that if British people could do it so can Indian people do that too, that´s why he only used “made in India” clothes.</p> <br>
                    <p>Colonies didn´t only have cotton. When Ghana was colonized by Britten Ghana was called gold coast and that´s because Ghana had a lot of gold, so Britten took that gold and used it. That is one of many things that happened in the modern era.</p>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                  <h3>Cities</h3>
                    <p>When rich people saw an opportunity to make more money by developing things they hired cheap people to work for them in their industries, the industries were developed to make finished products by the raw material which they got from the colonies, cotton as an example, they hired people who would work cheap, that was a revolution in the countryside part of the towns, the cities got bigger and almost the numbers of people living in the cities got doubled between 1890 and 1950. These people who moved into the cities got a work there which they maybe didn´t have in their home town or many changed their job to try something new, that helped the economy a lot in many countries. When people work they pay taxes, debts and rents to the estimates. That made many countries richer thanks to rich people who started industries around the world.</p>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                  <h3>stock market crash</h3>
                    <p>After October 1929 the stocks in the stock market went dropping, all stocks got cheaper and cheaper for every day. That was a reason for a big depression in America and affected the economy around the world. When people saw the prices going down they started selling their stocks because they didn’t want to lose a lot. The problem is that they lowered the price of the stocks to sell them faster and not lose much more, when everybody started doing that the stocks got a lot cheaper than their “real” price, this went on under a very long period so only three years after in 1932 the stocks were worth about 20 percent of the price before the crash. Many banks failed and a lot of people lost their jobs and their money, the crash lead to an economic collapse globally.</p>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                    <p id"economyend">So by the end of the article we can conclude that a lot of economic changes happened under the period of the modern era, many good and some bad but all changes are the reason for our global economy today.</p>
