He was the first British writer that came from a working-class background. His father worked in the coal mines and his mother was a teacher. Lawrence studied at University College in Nottingham and even worked as a teacher there for a while. His early novel Sons and Lovers is about a mining family.
He later on fell in love with his wife Richtofen and fled the country, they married in Germany 1914. But they had to return to England during the war, and it was something he didn’t like, he resented it. He was an outcast in many ways because of his social background. He was married to a women with German origin and a bad social background because of his working-class family.
They started to travel the world again as soon as the war ended until Lawrence’s death.he never once stopped writing during his time.

They are novels about human consciousness, and are explored through different aspects, mainly about relationships and bonds between men and women, in different forms.
Lawrence believed that humans and nature had a deep connection, even though the industrialised society. He shows an affection for man’s origin in nature and thinks that something could be pursued through physical love.
Because that his work had a lot of mature content about love, erotic and sexuality, he gained a reputation a naughty writer for a long time.
<br> <br>
“Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically. The cataclysm has happened, we are among the ruins, we start to build up new little habitats, to have
new little hopes. It is rather hard work: there is now no smooth road into the future
but we go round, or scramble over the obstacles. We’ve got to live, no matter how
many skies have fallen.”
<br> <br>
Lady Chatterley’s Lover is a very famous novel from 1928 from D.H. Lawrence, and his most famous novel. It’s a very erotic and lust-full novel.
And this quote is from Lady Chatterley’s Lover. And it speaks very loudly. “We’ve got to live, no matter how many skies have fallen.” He shows us that no matter what, even though that the times are hard, we can survive and keep going. Even though that it seems meaningless, you soldier on. “Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse it tragically.” War is  tragic but they were glorified at first. But tragic is in our nature, and even though it is horrible, we still live through it with a lot of love for life, for one another, everything is driven by lust.
