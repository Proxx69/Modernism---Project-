    <!-- Lawrences paragraph -->
        <h3>D.H Lawrence</h3>
        <p>David Herbert Lawrence was born at the 11th September 1885 in the United Kingdom, in Eastwood. He later on died at the 2nd of Mars 1930 in Franche. Lawrence only had one wife and her name was Frieda von Richtofen.
          He was the first British writer that came from a working-class background. His father worked in the coal mines and his mother was a teacher. Lawrence studied at University College in Nottingham and even worked as a teacher there for a while. His early novel Sons and Lovers is about a mining family.
          He later on fell in love with his wife Richtofen and fled the country, they married in Germany 1914. But they had to return to England during the war, and it was something he didn’t like, he resented it. He was an outcast in many ways because of his social background. He was married to a women with German origin and a bad social background because of his working-class family.
          They started to travel the world again as soon as the war ended until Lawrence’s death.he never once stopped writing during his time. He wrote not only novels, but als poetry, plays and critical essays. Two of his books are regarded as his masterpieces and they are known as “The Rainbow” (1915) and “Women in Love” (1921). They are novels about human consciousness, and are explored through different aspects, mainly about relationships and bonds between men and women, in different forms.
          Lawrence believed that humans and nature had a deep connection, even though the industrialised society. He shows an affection for man’s origin in nature and thinks that something could be pursued through physical love.
          Because that his work had a lot of mature content about love, erotic and sexuality, he gained a reputation a naughty writer for a long time.
          <br> <br>
          “Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically. The cataclysm has happened, we are among the ruins, we start to build up new little habitats, to have
          new little hopes. It is rather hard work: there is now no smooth road into the future
          but we go round, or scramble over the obstacles. We’ve got to live, no matter how
          many skies have fallen.”
          <br> <br>
          Lady Chatterley’s Lover is a very famous novel from 1928 from D.H. Lawrence, and his most famous novel. It’s a very erotic and lust-full novel.
          And this quote is from Lady Chatterley’s Lover. And it speaks very loudly. “We’ve got to live, no matter how many skies have fallen.” He shows us that no matter what, even though that the times are hard, we can survive and keep going. Even though that it seems meaningless, you soldier on. “Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse it tragically.” War is  tragic but they were glorified at first. But tragic is in our nature, and even though it is horrible, we still live through it with a lot of love for life, for one another, everything is driven by lust.</p>

              <br>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>Modernism (1901-1945) is a time-period full of politics and different conflicts of many kinds, which makes it an interesting time-period in our history to read about. This article is focusing on The First World War & The Second World War.</p>

                  <h3>The Great War</h3>
                    <p>The First World War (1914-1918) affected countries in Europe more than anything else before. The declaration of war against Germany in 1914 was looked at as an opportunity to break with the past and cleanse the air, with violence, of course. In the first weeks of war, more than half a million young men entered the military. The popular opinion was that soldiers and their loved ones had to be away from each other for a short time, then everything would be wonderful. The war, lasted four years but it ended lives of almost a whole generation. </p> <br>
                    <p>The Great War affected society in many ways. It made progress in healthcare, education and most importantly it changed the roles for women in society. Women became a major part of the workforce during the war. However, most women found themselves put back home when the war had ended and the soldiers came home.</p>

                  <h3>The Colapse of American Stock Exchange</h3>
                    <p>The collapse of the American stock exchange in 1929 had a major impact not only in America but in the entire world. In the early thirties unemployment reached an extreme level, an astounding three million people were unemployed. This was not over until the outbreak of the Second World War, but with a new world war, new depression and unhappiness was going to rule everybody's lives.</p>
                      <br>

              <!-- Fjärde paragraph -->
                  <h3>The Second World War</h3>
                    <p>The instability created in Europe by the The Great War (1914-1918) decided for another international conflict, World War II, which broke out around two decades after the first war. This war would be proven to be even more disastrous. In an economically and politically unstable Germany, Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist (Nazi Party) were rising in power. Hitler rearmed his nation and signed a strategic alliance with Italy and Japan to further his ambition of world supremacy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Second World War (1939 -1945) officially started on the 1st of September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland, that led to France and Britain declaring war upon the Axis powers. World War II had now officially begun, over the next six years, this war would take more lives and destroy more land all over the globe than any previous war.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Among the estimated 45 to 60 million people that missed their lives were six million Jews murdered in Nazi concentration camps as part of Hitler’s “Final Solution”, now more known as a catastrophe.</p>
                      <br>

              <!-- Femte paragraph -->
                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>To summarize this article, during this time, a lot of killing happened and politics were very controversial. In 1914 The Great War started which had tons of impacts on the society, politics and economy. After The First World War, there were a lot of instabilities in the society, economy and almost everywhere. This time of crisis led to The Second World War, this war was meant to fix the instabilities in Europe which were created by the first war. But the only thing The Second World War led to was a big catastrophe.</p>

              <h3>Gas</h3>
                <p>The gases that were used the most and banned later on.
                  Chlorine gas were a gas that killed a lot of men and very slowly, suffocating them. The unfortunate soul that got hit by the gas could suffer for days and be aware of it for the last 5 minutes before he or she died.
                  Mustard gas were a gas that wasn’t visible until 12 hours release. The body would start to rot both on the inside and outside. The pain were unbearable, and it would last up to 5 weeks before it killed you.</p>

                  <p>There weren’t any protection from the gas until Great Britain created the first gasmask that help us. They made up to 27 million different gasmasks under the wars. But they weren’t complete and couldn’t protect them for long or against anything. The Mustard gas were the real problem.</p>

                <h3>The First Weapon - Winchester Rifle</h3>
                  <p>The Winchester Rifle are one of the first rifles used in the world war. Because they had some real good damage up close and had a bayonet connected at the end of the rifle, made it easy for them to stab their opponents if they got too close. But they weren’t used that much because of the difficulty to handle and prone with. They were somewhat clumsy to handle.</p>

                  <p>Zeppelins were used in the first world war to carry different machine guns and bombs. However, they were left behind pretty fast because they were easy to shot out of the sky. Having them shot down from the sky made it problematic for both parties. They would kill their own men and the enemies.</p>

                  <p>The Mark L was the first tank to walk the battlefield, but it wasn’t so easy to steer. Great Britain made 49 tanks but only 32 made it to the front and 25 were able to be used in battle. 9 of the tanks conquered the village Flers.</p>

                <h3>Nuclear Weapon</h3>
                  <p>The first nuclear bomb to be used in war, was the bomb that completely destroyed Hiroshima and its citizens.
                    The nuclear bomb is such a fearsome weapon that it’s feared to be used by any country or war group. Because if there is ever going to be a nuclear war, then there probably won’t be anything left.</p>

                  <p>Plans were used in the war to spy on the enemy but they were easy targets to take down. But they advanced them a bit further later on, armed them with guns. The fights between pilots became known as “dog fights.”</p>

              <br>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>During the first half of the first century modernism started and that make a big change to the world, a lot of industries opened, many countries got colonized by the superpowers all around the world. A lot of economic changes happened during this specific era. This makes this period very interesting to read about. Focusing on economy will make you want to read the whole article to know how economy evolved.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
              <!-- Andra paragraph -->
                  <h3>Colonialism</h3>
                    <p>Under a long time during the modern many superpowers had colonized smaller countries in Africa and Asia. These superpowers took raw material from the colonies and transported these materials to their own country, and used it to make products. If we take Great Britten and India as an example, the British people took cotton from India to their country and made clothes of it, then they brought it back to India and sold it as a finished product, that made Indian people angry, one of the people who didn´t buy or even use these clothes was Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi thought that if British people could do it so can Indian people do that too, that´s why he only used “made in India” clothes.</p> <br>
                    <p>Colonies didn´t only have cotton. When Ghana was colonized by Britten Ghana was called gold coast and that´s because Ghana had a lot of gold, so Britten took that gold and used it. That is one of many things that happened in the modern era.</p>
                      <br>
                      <br>
              <!-- Tredje paragraph -->
                  <h3>Cities</h3>
                    <p>When rich people saw an opportunity to make more money by developing things they hired cheap people to work for them in their industries, the industries were developed to make finished products by the raw material which they got from the colonies, cotton as an example, they hired people who would work cheap, that was a revolution in the countryside part of the towns, the cities got bigger and almost the numbers of people living in the cities got doubled between 1890 and 1950. These people who moved into the cities got a work there which they maybe didn´t have in their home town or many changed their job to try something new, that helped the economy a lot in many countries. When people work they pay taxes, debts and rents to the estimates. That made many countries richer thanks to rich people who started industries around the world.</p>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                  <h3>Stock Market Crash</h3>
                    <p>After October 1929 the stocks in the stock market went dropping, all stocks got cheaper and cheaper for every day. That was a reason for a big depression in America and affected the economy around the world. When people saw the prices going down they started selling their stocks because they didn’t want to lose a lot. The problem is that they lowered the price of the stocks to sell them faster and not lose much more, when everybody started doing that the stocks got a lot cheaper than their “real” price, this went on under a very long period so only three years after in 1932 the stocks were worth about 20 percent of the price before the crash. Many banks failed and a lot of people lost their jobs and their money, the crash lead to an economic collapse globally.</p>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                    <p id"economyend">So by the end of the article we can conclude that a lot of economic changes happened under the period of the modern era, many good and some bad but all changes are the reason for our global economy today.</p>
