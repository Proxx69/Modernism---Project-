Introduction
Modernism (1901-1945) is a time-period full of politics and different conflicts of many kinds, which makes it an interesting time-period in our history to read about. This article is focusing on The First World War & The Second World War.

The Great War
The First World War (1914-1918) affected countries in Europe more than anything else before. The declaration of war against Germany in 1914 was looked at as an opportunity to break with the past and cleanse the air, with violence, of course. In the first weeks of war, more than half a million young men entered the military. The popular opinion was that soldiers and their loved ones had to be away from each other for a short time, then everything would be wonderful. The war, lasted four years but it ended lives of almost a whole generation. 

The Great War affected society in many ways. It made progress in healthcare, education and most importantly it changed the roles for women in society. Women became a major part of the workforce during the war. However, most women found themselves put back home when the war had ended and the soldiers came home.

The Collapse of American Stock Exchange
The collapse of the American stock exchange in 1929 had a major impact not only in America but in the entire world. In the early thirties unemployment reached an extreme level, an astounding three million people were unemployed. This was not over until the outbreak of the Second World War, but with a new world war, new depression and unhappiness was going to rule everybody's lives.

The Second World War
The instability created in Europe by the The Great War (1914-1918) decided for another international conflict, World War II, which broke out around two decades after the first war. This war would be proven to be even more disastrous. In an economically and politically unstable Germany, Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist (Nazi Party) were rising in power. Hitler rearmed his nation and signed a strategic alliance with Italy and Japan to further his ambition of world supremacy. 

The Second World War (1939 -1945) officially started on the 1st of September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland, that led to France and Britain declaring war upon the Axis powers. World War II had now officially begun, over the next six years, this war would take more lives and destroy more land all over the globe than any previous war. 

Among the estimated 45 to 60 million people that missed their lives were six million Jews murdered in Nazi concentration camps as part of Hitler’s “Final Solution”, now more known as a catastrophe.
